# snesref

A standalone, hardware-accurate **reference interpreter with debugging tools**,
used as the differential oracle when chasing bugs in the recompiled build.

> Formerly named `mmxref`, then `snes-oracle`; settled on **snesref** to pair
> with the Genesis equivalent [`mdref`](https://github.com/mstan/mdref).

Under the hood it is a minimal SDL2 [libretro](https://www.libretro.com/)
frontend that loads a real SNES emulator core (an interpreter such as
`snes9x_libretro.dll`) and drives it while capturing the same instrumentation
the recomp runner's `debug_server` exposes. You play the game on a known-good
interpreter, capture a trace, and diff it against the recompiled run to pinpoint
the first divergence — register, RAM byte, or frame.

It is the successor to the old in-process `runner/snes9x-core` oracle (now
removed): instead of statically linking a patched emulator into every game's
`Oracle|x64` build, you run this one small tool against any libretro SNES core.

> Stood up while debugging Mega Man X (the Rangda Bangda eye and the Spark
> Mandrill dash-jump turtle), so state filenames retain an `mmx_*` prefix — but
> it works with any SNES ROM and any libretro SNES core.

## Why a separate interpreter, not the recompiler

The recompiler translates 65816 to native C ahead of time; subtle timing/state
bugs only show up as a *divergence from real hardware*. You need a trusted,
cycle-faithful reference to diff against. An interpreting emulator core is that
reference. Keeping it as a separate tool (rather than embedded in the runner)
means the shipping game exes carry none of it, and the reference can be swapped
for any libretro SNES core.

## Features

- **Per-frame WRAM diff trace** → `snesref_trace.jsonl`, one record per frame of
  changed WRAM bytes, in the exact JSON shape as the recomp `debug_server`'s
  `wram_writes_at`. Drop it beside a recomp capture and diff frame-by-frame.
- **Save/load state slots** (`Shift+F1` through `Shift+F9` to save, `F1`
  through `F9` to load) so you can park at a hard-to-reach game state and
  re-run the suspicious window deterministically.
- **Recomp-matched input** — the keyboard map mirrors the recomp runner's
  keybinds, so the same inputs reproduce the same run on both sides.
- **Any core, any ROM** — the emulator core is `argv[1]`; nothing is hard-wired
  to a specific core or game.
- **Fresh-capture toggle** (`F5`) to clear the trace and start a clean window.
- **Tiny + dependency-light** — one C++ translation unit, SDL2, and the libretro API
  header. No build coupling to the recompiler.

## Build

```bat
:: 1. extract the SDL2 VC dev package here as SDL2-2.30.9\   (libsdl.org)
:: 2. build
build.bat
```

Produces `snesref.exe`.

## Run

```bat
snesref.exe <core.dll> <rom.sfc>
:: e.g. snesref.exe snes9x_libretro.dll mmx.sfc
```

Place the libretro core DLL (and its `SDL2.dll`) next to the exe, or pass a path.

### Deterministic capture

Environment variables select non-interactive capture outputs:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SNESREF_FAST=1` | Hide the window and disable frame pacing. |
| `SNESREF_FRAMES=N` | Exit after exactly `N` emulated frames. |
| `SNESREF_INPUT_FILE=path` | Apply deterministic scripted joypad input. |
| `SNESREF_WRAM_FILL=byte` | Fill exposed system WRAM before frame 1; use `0` to match SNESRecomp's hard-reset state. |
| `SNESREF_WRAM_DUMP=path` | Write the core's final exposed system WRAM image. |
| `SNESREF_TRACE_FILE=path` | Write low-WRAM change records as JSONL. |
| `SNESREF_WAV=path` | Write core output as a PCM WAV file. |
| `SNESREF_FRAME_DUMP_DIR=path` | Write selected frames as 256x224 BGRX raw files. |
| `SNESREF_FRAME_DUMP_FROM=N` | First frame eligible for a frame dump. |
| `SNESREF_FRAME_DUMP_TO=N` | Last frame eligible for a frame dump. |
| `SNESREF_FRAME_DUMP_STEP=N` | Dump every `N`th eligible frame. |
| `SNESREF_APURAM_TRACE_FILE=path` | Trace SPC RAM when supported by a patched core. |
| `SNESREF_DSPREG_TRACE_FILE=path` | Trace S-DSP registers when supported by a patched core. |

An input script contains one `start-frame:duration:hex-mask` event per line.
Events may overlap and comments begin with `#`.

```text
# Press Start for two frames, then B for one frame.
650:2:008
780:1:001
```

The 12-bit mask is:

| Bit | Mask | Button |
|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | `001` | B |
| 1 | `002` | Y |
| 2 | `004` | Select |
| 3 | `008` | Start |
| 4 | `010` | Up |
| 5 | `020` | Down |
| 6 | `040` | Left |
| 7 | `080` | Right |
| 8 | `100` | A |
| 9 | `200` | X |
| 10 | `400` | L |
| 11 | `800` | R |

Example:

```powershell
$env:SNESREF_FAST = "1"
$env:SNESREF_FRAMES = "1800"
$env:SNESREF_WRAM_FILL = "0"
$env:SNESREF_INPUT_FILE = "menu-input.txt"
$env:SNESREF_TRACE_FILE = "wram.jsonl"
$env:SNESREF_WAV = "reference.wav"
$env:SNESREF_FRAME_DUMP_DIR = "frames"
.\snesref.exe C:\cores\bsnes_libretro.dll C:\roms\game.sfc
```

### Keys (match the recomp keybinds)

| Key | SNES | | Key | Action |
|-----|------|-|-----|--------|
| Arrows | D-pad | | Shift+F1-F9 | save state slot |
| Z | B (jump) | | F1-F9 | load state slot |
| X | A | | Backspace | clear the WRAM trace |
| A | Y (fire) | | Enter | Start |
| S | X | | RShift | Select |
| C / V | L / R | | Esc | quit |
