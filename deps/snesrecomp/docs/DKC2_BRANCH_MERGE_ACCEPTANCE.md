# DKC2 Branch Merge Acceptance

## Candidate

The starting point and merge candidate is the snesrecomp branch
`codex/dkc2-hirom-static-coverage` (draft PR #4). The purpose of this branch is
to make DKC2 work through faithful static recompilation without regressing the
existing SNES consumers.

`main` may be used as a diagnostic baseline only. Replacing, abandoning, or
substantially reverting the DKC2 work is not an acceptable regression fix.
Cross-game validation must consume this same candidate branch from isolated
worktrees; it must not modify the other games' main branches.

## Required five-game matrix

The branch is not merge-ready until all five games pass on the same engine
revision:

| Game | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Donkey Kong Country 2 | DKC2 static-coverage behavior remains working |
| Super Mario World | No hangs, crashes, visual corruption, or garbled audio |
| The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past | No hangs, crashes, visual corruption, or garbled audio |
| Mega Man X | No hangs, crashes, visual corruption, or garbled audio |
| Super Metroid | No hangs, crashes, visual corruption, or garbled audio |

Every title requires both:

1. Automated validation: clean generation/build, deterministic attract soak,
   inspected framebuffer captures, structured runtime/state checks, and audio
   capture checks.
2. User validation: an intentional visible launch and brief gameplay test after
   the automated preflight has passed.

Frame advancement, readable WRAM, successful compilation, or process survival
alone do not constitute a pass. Unknown and untested are not pass states.

## Fix and evidence rules

- Use the original program/disassembly and interpreter or independent emulator
  as appropriate oracles. Generated C is evidence, not authority.
- Find the first deterministic divergence and fix the recompiler/runtime class;
  do not edit generated C or hide engine bugs with per-game CFG/HLE workarounds.
- Use structured, bounded debug surfaces rather than print-log instrumentation.
- Capture and inspect a screenshot before asserting visible state.
- Validate the harness itself for deterministic replay and fault detection
  before trusting cross-backend comparisons.
- Rerun the complete five-game matrix after every shared-engine correctness fix.
- Keep ROMs, save states, screenshots, audio captures, and other copyrighted or
  private test artifacts out of public commits.

## Current truthful status

The runtime candidate tested below is `79592db`. All generation in this matrix
uses the native Rust analyzer. DKC2's sound final profile contains 3,425 AOT
variants and 42 interpreter fallbacks (98.79% AOT); Super Metroid's contains
880 AOT variants and 124 fallbacks (87.65% AOT). These are compile-time exact
variant counts, not claims about the percentage of dynamically executed CPU
instructions.

Post-release update (2026-07-21): the original acceptance matrix below remains
the evidence for candidate `79592db`. The current DKC2 consumer configuration,
together with the later stack-reset dispatch and generic non-returning-JSR
contracts, converges in both analyzers on 3,468/3,468 demanded exact variants
AOT and zero LLE-only code nodes. Two documented dormant crash calls retain
explicit interpreter edges to their exact non-code destinations; the
interpreter remains the semantic fallback and has not been removed.

| Game | Automated runtime/video | Automated audio | User gameplay |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DKC2 | Pass: fresh Rust regeneration, 12,000-frame soak, two complete attract cycles, zero sequence errors, and inspected clean framebuffer | Pass: sustained nonzero SPC output, zero clipped samples, and bounded output deltas | Pass on the candidate line; the final shared delta is restricted to the independently checked DSP correction |
| SMW | Pass: 7,200-frame attract soak, zero dispatch misses, stable WRAM hash, and inspected clean framebuffer | Pass: active consumer, zero drops/clipping, BRR and echo bit-exact, Gaussian reference within rounding bounds | Pass; the user confirmed normal-pacing gameplay |
| LttP | Pass: exact indoor-to-overworld save transition, 7,200-frame soak, zero dispatch misses, and inspected clean framebuffer | Pass: active consumer, zero audible drops/clipping, BRR and echo bit-exact, Gaussian reference within rounding bounds | Pass; the user exercised the previously failing overworld transition |
| MMX | Pass: 7,200-frame title/intro soak, zero dispatch misses, stable WRAM hash, and inspected clean framebuffer | Pass: active consumer, no audible drops/clipping, BRR and echo bit-exact, Gaussian reference within rounding bounds | Pass; the user also exercised the password route |
| Super Metroid | Pass: 7,200-frame title/cinematic soak, zero dispatch misses, stable WRAM hash, and inspected framebuffer | Pass: active consumer, zero drops/clipping, BRR and echo bit-exact, Gaussian reference within rounding bounds | Pass; the user completed a brief gameplay check |

The LttP transition regression was a class-level computed-RTS ownership bug in
the interpreter/AOT bridge. Commit `be4a706` fixes it and includes emitted-code
and bridge-runtime regressions. The no-deny save transition now reaches the
known-good state hash
`81d71b22fc929c218fa57335c6e5f5b7da50fb3182dd585cd018d11c15efa716`.

The audio gates require active nonzero PCM, no clipping, no audible ring drops,
an active consumer, and populated faithful Gaussian/BRR/echo reference
measurements. Runtime/video success does not substitute for this gate. The BRR
and echo checks first exposed two shared DSP mismatches; `79592db` fixes their
hardware semantics and retains a structured first-divergence witness.

Draft PR #4 remains a draft until every row passes both automated and user
validation and there are no known hangs, crashes, visual bugs, or garbled audio
in the exercised coverage.
