"""snesrecomp.recompiler.v2.decoder

Worklist-driven 65816 decoder keyed by (PC, M, X) entry state.

REPLACES THE V1 DECODE BUG: v1's `decode_func` (recomp.py:52-354) tracks
M/X as linear scalars and stores branch-target mode hints in
`pending_flags: Dict[PC, (m, x)]` with explicit last-writer-wins overwrite
(recomp.py:298-300 comment makes this explicit). When two predecessors
reach the same PC with different (m, x), one is silently dropped and that
PC ends up decoded with the wrong mode — which is invalid for 65816
because variable-length immediate operands (LDA #imm in M=1 vs M=0) are
2 bytes vs 3 bytes, so the dropped mode can corrupt every subsequent
instruction's PC offset.

In v2, every instruction is identified by `DecodeKey(pc, m, x)`. Two
predecessors with different mode states produce two distinct
DecodedInsn records at the same PC — both are preserved. Downstream
(v2 cfg / IR / codegen) treats them as two separate blocks.

The opcode table in `snes65816.py` and the per-instruction
`decode_insn(rom, off, pc, bank, m, x)` helper are reused as-is — they
already correctly compute variable-length immediates *given* an (m, x)
input. The bug was always in the v1 caller, not in `decode_insn`.

    INLINE-ARGUMENT routine, returning the inline byte count N (or None).

    An inline-arg routine reads its own return address off the stack, uses
    the N bytes immediately following the call site as a parameter, and
    ADVANCES the stacked return address by a constant N so its RTS/RTL
    returns PAST the inline data. The game-agnostic 65816 signature:

        LDA $rr,S        ; load the current return-address-low slot
        ... (A preserved: STA dp/abs, CLC/SEC) ...
        ADC #N           ; advance the return address by N

    N is the count of inline bytes every call site must skip after the

    of the callee's own code). Canonical case: Super Metroid

    Conservative by construction: only the exact load-add-store-back-to-
    same-slot idiom matches, and any A-clobbering instruction in between
    resets the match — so a routine that merely reads its return address
    (e.g. a JSL dispatch helper) without adding a constant and storing it
    back is NOT flagged. Returns None on the first terminator or after a
    short instruction budget.

    The routine is assumed to be entered in binary mode. SED and SEP #$08
    set the decimal flag, CLD and REP #$08 clear it, and PHP/PLP carry it the
    same way they carry M/X. ADC #imm in decimal mode is BCD and does not
    yield a usable byte count, so it stops the match."""

# ── decode_function memoization cache ───────────────────────────────
#
# decode_function is pure for fixed inputs: no module-level mutable
# state is read, and grep verifies external callers never mutate the
# returned FunctionDecodeGraph (only decoder.py itself writes to
# graph.insns inside the worklist). Returned graphs are therefore safe
# to share across callers via cache. Callers must not mutate; doing so
# poisons the cached entry for every subsequent caller with the same
# key.
#
# Key composition: immutable ROM bytes + primitive args + a strong-reference
# identity token for every Optional dict/list/set.
#
# Why hash(rom): rom bytes are immutable; CPython caches the hash on
# the bytes object after first compute (O(n) once, O(1) thereafter).
# id(rom) would NOT be safe across multiple bytes objects in one
# process — Python may reuse the address of a GC'd object.
#
# Why identity for dict/list/set kwargs (NOT _freeze): freezing big dicts
# (callee_exit_mx in a late auto-promote pass has thousands of items)
# is O(N) per decode call. With ~30k decode calls per pass × full
# freeze of a 10k-item dict per call, the freeze dominates wall-clock
# and makes A1 a regression vs the pre-cache pipeline. id() is O(1).
# A bare id() still permits address reuse because the integer does not retain
# the object. _ObjectIdentity below owns a strong reference and compares by
# identity, closing that collision without an O(N) semantic freeze.
# Callers must not mutate a kwarg dict while passing it to
# decode_function — that would poison the cache silently.
#
# **Memory bounding is the caller's responsibility.** Different
# pipeline phases pass different kwarg combinations, so the same
# (entry, m, x) tuple gets cached under N keys across N phases.
# v2_regen.py calls clear_decode_cache() at every phase boundary.

    """Decode a function starting at (bank, start) with entry (m, x) state.

    Worklist over DecodeKey tuples. Each key is decoded at most once;
    same PC with divergent (m, x) produces multiple keys → multiple
    DecodedInsn records.

    `dispatch_helpers`: optional map of {target_addr_24 -> 'short'|'long'}.
    When a JSL/JML hits a target in this map, the bytes immediately AFTER
    the JSL are decoded as a function-pointer TABLE (not as instructions).
    Each table entry is recorded as a successor key (so the dispatched
    handlers get decoded too) and the ORIGINAL JSL is marked with
    `insn.dispatch_entries` for downstream codegen. Decode resumes
    AFTER the table (not at the JSL+length offset). Without this hook,
    SMW's "JSL Foo; .dw target0, target1, ..." pattern at $00:9325 would
    decode the TABLE BYTES as garbage instructions.

    `indirect_call_tables`: optional map of {site_pc24 -> dict} where
    each value is `{'base': int, 'count': int, 'kind': 'short'|'long'}`.
    Authorises a JSR (abs,X) site as a real indirect dispatch. When
    set, the decoder reads `count` table entries at `bank:base`,
    stamps `insn.dispatch_entries`, and adds the entries as decode
    successors so handlers get decoded too. Without an entry, JSR
    (abs,X) is treated as cfg-unauthorised: the insn is placed in the
    graph with no successors (severing fall-through) and recorded in
    graph.suppressed_indirect_calls for the build report. See the
    cfg-required-dispatch-or-kill rule documented on
    SuppressedIndirectCall.

    `sibling_entry_pcs`: optional set of 16-bit PCs in THIS bank that
    are named function entries OTHER than `start`. When a `jump` edge
    crosses end: and lands on a sibling entry, the decoder refuses the
    inline-import — the boundary becomes a tail-call handled by
    emit_function's `_goto_or_return`. Without this gate, the inline-
    cross-fn-blocks model would import the sibling's entire body into
    THIS function's CFG (the Zelda intro-loop root cause 2026-05-17:
    Intro_Init_Continue's BCS to Intro_InitializeMemory_darken at
    $0C:C1F5 inlined darken into Intro_Init_Continue's body, so darken's
    `submodule_index++` ran on a wrong path and submodule oscillated
    0→1→2→0 instead of progressing).

    The PHB/PLB-balanced cross-fn-jump case is preserved because those
    targets are NOT named function entries — the inline-import path
    still applies. Only cfg-named entries get the tail-call routing.

    Walks every terminator in `graph` and takes the meet of the (m, x)

      - RTS/RTL/RTI: don't modify M/X, so each terminator's
        `(insn.m_flag, insn.x_flag)` IS the (m, x) at the moment of
        return.

      - JSL/JML dispatch terminator (`insn.dispatch_entries` populated
        and no fall-through successors): the dispatcher transfers
        control to a handler which RTLs back to OUR caller. The
        effective exit state at this terminator is whichever (m, x)
        the dispatched handler RTLs with. Requires `callee_exit_mx`
        to have an entry for each table target keyed by the dispatch
        site's (m, x); if any handler's exit is unknown we return
        `(None, None)` (retry on a later auto-router pass once more
        callees converge).

        Soundness note: the JSL dispatch helper itself runs in a
        canonical state (e.g. SMW's `$00:86FA` runs with the
        dispatcher's `(m, x)` and forwards without restoring P), so
        the handler is entered with the dispatch SITE's (m, x). Each
        handler's `callee_exit_mx[(target, site_m, site_x)]` IS the
        handler's RTL (m, x), which becomes our function's effective
        exit.

    If all return paths exit with the same (m, x), returns that pair.
    If any two return paths disagree, the corresponding component is
    `None` (ambiguous — the caller's decoder should fall back to its
    pre-call assumption rather than commit to a wrong width).
