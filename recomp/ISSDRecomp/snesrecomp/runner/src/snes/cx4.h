/* Capcom Cx4 — a Hitachi HG51B S169 DSP in a Capcom package.
 *
 * Used by exactly two commercial titles: Mega Man X2 and Mega Man X3. Both
 * declare it through the internal header as chipset $F3 (ROM + coprocessor,
 * coprocessor id $F "custom") with the $FFBF sub-type byte $10.
 *
 * This is INSTRUCTION-LEVEL emulation: the DSP fetches and executes the Cx4
 * program out of cartridge ROM, so it is the faithful floor per PRINCIPLES.md
 * rather than a host-side reimplementation of what that program computes.
 * There is consequently no "unknown command" surface — whatever the game's own
 * Cx4 code does, the core runs.
 *
 * Ported from ares (ISC licence) — see THIRD_PARTY_ATTRIBUTION.md.
 *
 * ── CPU-visible map (Mapping 0, which is what MMX2/X3 use) ────────────────
 *
 *   $00-$3F,$80-$BF:$6000-$6BFF   3 KB DSP data RAM  (mirrored at $7000-$7BFF)
 *   $00-$3F,$80-$BF:$6C00-$6FFF   IO window          (mirrored at $7C00-$7FFF)
 *     ...within which:
 *       $7F40-$7F47   DMA source / length / target  (target byte 2 triggers)
 *       $7F48-$7F4F   program cache: page, base, locks, entry PB/PC
 *                     $7F4F ALSO STARTS THE DSP when it is halted — the value
 *                     is the entry program counter, not a command id
 *       $7F50-$7F5F   wait states, IRQ enable, ROM config, suspend, status
 *       $7F60-$7F7F   32 vector bytes
 *       $7F80-$7FAF   general-purpose registers R0-R15, 3 bytes each
 *       $7FC0-$7FEF   mirror of the GPR window
 *   $00-$3F,$80-$BF:$8000-$FFFF   ordinary LoROM
 *   $70-$77:$0000-$7FFF           cartridge save RAM (neither X2 nor X3 has any)
 *
 * The DSP runs at 20 MHz against the SNES's ~21.477 MHz master clock, so it
 * must be advanced before any observation of its state — see cx4_sync().
