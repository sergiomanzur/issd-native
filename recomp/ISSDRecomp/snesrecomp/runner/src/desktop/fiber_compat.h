 * fiber_compat.h — cross-platform fiber API for cooperative game task
 * scheduler (mmx_rtl.c).
 *
 * The scheduler cooperatively switches between a "scheduler" fiber and one
 * fiber per task slot, each with its own C stack so a task can yield mid-call
 * and resume later. On Windows this is the native Fiber API. On POSIX there is
 * no Fiber API, so we provide an equivalent backed by ucontext_t — same five
 * entry points, same semantics — so mmx_rtl.c is identical on both platforms.
